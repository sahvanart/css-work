# css-work

In this project are included some of my first websites, pages or components built mainly in HTML and CSS. Some may include other languages but the idea was to work with and discover CSS : properties but also responsiveness using flexbox or grid displays. Is also included some css frameworks and Sass preprocessor language learning.
